\begin{abstract}
  We present our experience on replicating a bug dataset for the Python programming language.
  The bug dataset provides some information about the software environment, but this environment decays quickly into something uninstallable.
  We assess the reproducibility over time and improve the reproducibility of the dataset.

\section{Introduction}

What is BugsInPy~\cite{widyasari_bugsinpy_2020}.

Why does it exist.

What information does the dataset contain.

\section{Methodology}

Explain the bugsinpy-testall script.

Explain how Conda packaging works.

Explain how Pip and PyPI works.

\section{Results}

Table containing results with Debian 11 and results with Conda

\section{Discussion}

What makes our reproduction easy.

What makes our reproduction hard.

\subsection{Recommendations to BugsInPy users}

\subsection{Recommendations to artifact authors}

\subsection{Threats to validity}

Is it possible that our reproduction is not working when it should be?

Is it possible that our reproduction won't be reproducible by others?

\section{Conclusion}

Does our study support the conclusion?

Future directions for research?

\begin{itemize}
\item Improve reproducibility of BugsInPy
\item Improve description of software environments.
\item Make reproducibility tools easier to use.
\end{itemize}
